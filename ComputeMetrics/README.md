# Wishlist

- Add COMMIT mode: given a commit, compute metrics from the list of files and export aggregates too (mean, median, sum, max, min)
- Re-implement the basic idea of `mining` package: enable historical analyses of a set of files (i.e., check these N files across M revisions)
- Remove the obsolete CKMetrics and all other legacy code
- Remove obsolete code from the `parser` and `bean` packages
